React with ChatGPT

## How to install

- First run the following command, `npm install` and `npm start`.
- First you need to create the api keys, you can do that from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
- From the same place, you might need to buy some tokens and or credits, so the API start to work (enables communication with the chatGPT, every query cost a small amount of money).
- Create the `.env` file to document root, this is where you store the api key. The `.env` file looks like this, `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>` .
